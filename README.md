This tool is designed to simplify the process of extracting radiomics features from medical images, making it accessible even for users with minimal programming experience. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of the pyRadiomics library, our app allows researchers, clinicians, and data scientists to easily obtain radiomic features by simply dragging and dropping their image files, masks, and labels.
